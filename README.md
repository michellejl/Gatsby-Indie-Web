# Homebase

This project is an expanded version of my portfolio site that will act as a homebase of sorts for my own projects. It will include things like a list of what extensions I like in my VSCode setup, or a list of bookmarks I've been meaning to go back to. 



## Install and Develop on this project: 
1. ``node --version``` should equal 10.5.x
2. Gatsby should be installed.
3. Clone or download project and ```cd``` into it.
4. Run ```npm install```
5. Run ```gatsby develop```
6. Go to ```localhost:8000``` in a browser to see site. Saved changes will live reload in the browser.
7. Use ```gatsby build``` to create an optimized production build for the project.
8. Test the production build by using ```gatsby serve``` to start a local HTML server

## My Development Steps:
1. ```node --version``` should equal 10.5.x
2. Install gatsby: ```npm install --global gatsby-cli```
3. Create new project from gatsby-starter-blog: 
    ```sh
    gatsby new homebase https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default#v2
    ```
4. Run project in development mode: ```gatsby develop```
