"A note is a post that is typically short unstructured* plain text, written & posted quickly, that has its own permalink page.  (* Though unstructured meaning without a heading/title or any other explicit structure, notes can include several lines of text or even lists using "*" or numerical markers due to common whitespace support.)" - [indieweb.org/note](https://indieweb.org/note)
